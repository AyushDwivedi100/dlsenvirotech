## 🚀 How to Deploy (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Set Your Domain (One-Time Setup)

Open `client/.env.production` and change the domain:

```env
VITE_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
```

**Important:** 
- ✅ Use just the domain: `dlsenvirotech.com`
- ❌ Don't include: `https://` or `www.`

### Step 2: Build Your Website

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

**What happens automatically:**
- ✅ Your domain replaces `dlsenvirotech.com` in all SEO files
- ✅ Sitemap dates update to today
- ✅ All files optimized and ready for upload
- ✅ Static files created in `client/dist/` folder

### Step 3: Upload to Hostinger

1. Login to Hostinger hPanel
2. Go to File Manager
3. Upload **ALL files** from `client/dist/` to `/public_html/`
4. Done! Your website is live! 🎉

## 📦 What Gets Generated Automatically

Every time you run `npm run build`, these files are created in `client/dist/`:

| File | Purpose | Auto-Updated |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `index.html` | Main website file | ✅ |
| `.htaccess` | Server config (HTTPS, routing) | ✅ |
| `manifest.json` | PWA support | ✅ |
| `robots.txt` | Search engine rules | ✅ **With your domain** |
| `sitemap.xml` | XML sitemap | ✅ **With your domain & today's date** |
| `sitemap.txt` | Text sitemap | ✅ **With your domain** |
| `assets/` | CSS, JavaScript, images | ✅ |

## 🔧 What the Automation Does

### Before Build:
1. Reads your domain from `client/.env.production`
2. Updates `robots.txt` with your sitemap URL
3. Replaces ALL URLs in `sitemap.xml` with your domain
4. Replaces ALL URLs in `sitemap.txt` with your domain
5. Updates all `<lastmod>` dates in sitemap to today

### During Build:
1. Optimizes all CSS and JavaScript
2. Compresses images
3. Copies all files from `public/` to `dist/`
4. Creates production-ready static files

### Result:
- ✅ Everything ready to upload
- ✅ No manual editing needed
- ✅ SEO files always up-to-date
