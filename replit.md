## Deployment Strategy

### Automated Build Process

1. **Configure Domain** (one-time):
   - Edit `client/.env.production`
   - Set `VITE_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com`

2. **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run build
   ```
   
   This automatically:
   - Replaces domain in all SEO files
   - Updates sitemap dates
   - Generates optimized static files
   - Creates production-ready `dist/` folder

3. **Deploy to Hostinger**:
   - Upload ALL files from `client/dist/` to `/public_html/`
   - Via File Manager, FTP, or Git auto-deployment

### Generated Files for Hostinger

The `client/dist/` folder contains:
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `.htaccess` - Apache configuration (HTTPS, SPA routing, caching, compression)
- `manifest.json` - PWA manifest
- `robots.txt` - Search engine crawling rules (with your domain)
- `sitemap.xml` - XML sitemap (with your domain and current date)
- `sitemap.txt` - Text sitemap (with your domain)
- `assets/` - Optimized CSS, JavaScript, and images

### Build Automation Features

- **Domain Replacement**: Automatically replaces placeholder domain with actual domain from `.env.production`
- **Date Updates**: Automatically updates sitemap `<lastmod>` tags with current date
- **Pre-build Script**: Runs before every build (`client/scripts/prebuild.js`)
- **SEO Optimization**: All SEO files generated with correct domain and dates
- **Apache Configuration**: `.htaccess` handles all SPA routing, HTTPS, caching, compression

### Environment Configuration
- Domain configured in `client/.env.production`
- Automatic prebuild script handles all file updates
- No manual editing of sitemaps or robots.txt required
- Static file serving via Apache on Hostinger

### Scalability Considerations
- Static website - no server-side dependencies
- All routing handled client-side via React Router (Wouter)
- `.htaccess` ensures all routes load correctly
- PWA-ready for offline capabilities and app-like experience
- Optimized build with code splitting and lazy loading

## Deployment Documentation

- **README.md** - Quick overview and project information
- **QUICK-DEPLOY.md** - Simple 3-step deployment guide (recommended)
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Comprehensive deployment instructions with troubleshooting
- **client/.env.production** - Domain configuration file
- **client/scripts/prebuild.js** - Automated build script for domain replacement

## Important Notes

- This is a **static website** - no Node.js backend required for production
- Backend code in `server/` directory is for development only (not used in production)
- Hostinger Premium only supports static files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- All API calls would need to be external services or removed for production
- Contact form currently uses mock API (replace with external service like Formspree, EmailJS, or similar)
